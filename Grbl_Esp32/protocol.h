// NOTE: Not a problem except for extreme cases, but the line buffer size can be too small
// and g-code blocks can get truncated. Officially, the g-code standards support up to 256
// characters. In future versions, this will be increased, when we know how much extra
// memory space we can invest into here or we re-write the g-code parser not to have this
// buffer.
